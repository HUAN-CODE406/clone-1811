            <strong>1. How do cloud platforms enable the storage and processing of large datasets required for real-world AI projects?</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Cloud platforms support AI projects in handling large datasets by providing distributed storage, elastic computing resources, and efficient data processing tools. They dynamically adjust resources based on needs, rapidly process data via high-performance networks, and reduce costs with a pay-as-you-go model. These features make cloud platforms particularly valuable and effective for AI projects that require handling extensive data.
